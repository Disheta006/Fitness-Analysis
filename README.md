# 🏃‍♀️ Personal Health & Fitness Analysis

A Python-based data visualization project that analyzes daily fitness and health metrics such as step count, body weight trends, and macro-nutrient distribution using Matplotlib.
The project presents insights through clear and visually appealing charts to help track personal health progress over a week.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing personal fitness data collected over a week and presenting it in an easy-to-understand graphical format. It highlights:

- Daily physical activity levels

- Body weight trends

- Nutritional macro distribution

The goal is to demonstrate **data visualization, analysis skills, and real-world application of Python**.


## 📊 Features & Visualizations

**1️⃣ Daily Step Count Analysis**

* Bar chart representation of daily steps

* Step goal line for comparison

* Color-coded bars:

  - 🟢 Green → Goal achieved

  - ⚪ Gray → Goal not achieved

**2️⃣ Body Weight Trend**

* Line graph showing weight changes across the week

* Highlighted lowest weight day

* Helps track consistency and progress

**3️⃣ Daily Macro Distribution**

* Pie chart showing nutritional breakdown:

   - Carbohydrates: 45%

   - Fats: 30%

   - Protein: 25%

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used

* **Programming Language:** Python

* **Libraries:**

  - matplotlib

* **Tools:** Python IDE / Jupyter Notebook
